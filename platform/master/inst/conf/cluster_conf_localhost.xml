     Cluster configuration file
     ServerInfo contains the IP address(hostname) and port number of master.
     StartPortRange and EndPortRange specifies the port number range that will be used by a master.
     The run-time will select a random open port within the range.
     If there is not an available port in the range, an exception is thrown.
     In a master node, the port number range has to contain at least two open ports (mandatory)

     Within Workers field, multiple worker information can be filled.
     Worker field contains Hostname/IP address and port range, and they are mandatory.
     StartPortRange and EndPortRange specifies the port number range that will be used by a worker.
     The port number range of a worker has to contain at least 2*(number of workers)+1 open ports (mandatory)
     In a multi-worker cluster, loop-back address (either 127.0.0.1 or localhost)
     should not be used as it prohibits inter-node communication.
     Executors set the number of R instances. If the value is 0, runtime will determine
     automatically as (the number of cores in the machine).
     SharedMemory element contains information about the darray quota in MB. If this is 0,
     runtime will automatically determine by considering the size of mounted shared memory region.
     Executors and SharedMemory fileds are optional - if they are missing either default value (0) or argument value will be used.
